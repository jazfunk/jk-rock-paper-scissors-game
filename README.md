## Summary
Building this game was slightly challenging.  Although the intial logic to determine a winner was fairly simple, I spent a great deal of time experimenting with CSS styles, and making the UI elements dynamic in regards to game play.  While developing this game, I discovered how valuable CSS can be; used in conjunction with JavaScript, you can make your webpage stand out.
