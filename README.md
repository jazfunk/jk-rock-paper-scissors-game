## Summary
Building this game was slightly challenging.  Although the intial logic to determine a winner was fairly simple, I spent a great deal of time experimenting with CSS styles, and making the UI elements dynamic in regards to game play.  While developing this game, I discovered how valuable CSS can be; used in conjunction with JavaScript, you can make your webpage stand out.

An important coding technique I learned was the "Single Responsibility Principle"; to make sure functions do one thing, and do it well.  By keeping them limited, it makes for easier debugging, and other programmers can understand the code better.  

Finally, gaining the understanding of reducing global variables to limit the potential for conflicts between other libraries and resources was invaluable for me as I strive to hone my craft.
